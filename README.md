My report to the Swiss FASF on the activities of the Interchain Foundation


## Who are you?

I'm Jacob Anthony Gadikian.  I've worked in Cosmos since about 2016, but I began to do full time work in the ecosystem in 2020.  I am the CEO and founder of Notional Ventures, which used to run 45 validators in the cosmos ecosystem.  I am also a security researcher whose work tends to focus on the interplay between systems in cryptocurrency, and has been categorically denied by the Interchain foundation, despite ample proof.  I prefer to speak and act directly, so I am doing this in a public fashion, my report to the FASF is this repository.  I will speak to the FASF only over Signal, other than the initial e-mail that I send them with this repository and my signal contact information. 

I do fear retaliation, both personal and professional, and I believe that being direct about my complaint and publishing my complaint is the safest path forward for myself and my family.
