My report to the Swiss FASF on the activities of the Interchain Foundation


## Who are you?

I'm Jacob Anthony Gadikian.  I've worked in Cosmos since about 2016, but I began to do full time work in the ecosystem in 2020.  I am the CEO and founder of Notional Ventures, which used to run 45 validators in the cosmos ecosystem.  

* I am a beneficiary of the ICF, as my validator nodes recieved delegations from them.
* My company was [elected as the security provider to the Cosmos Hub](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/104)

All of the information here, I have presented to the ICF.  Yet, the ICF has taken no action on it.  As time has gone on, things have only grown worse, and 

I am also a security researcher whose work tends to focus on the interplay between systems in cryptocurrency, and has been categorically denied by the Interchain foundation, despite ample proof.  I prefer to speak and act directly, so I am doing this in a public fashion, my report to the FASF is this repository.  I will speak to the FASF only over Signal, other than the initial e-mail that I send them with this repository and my signal contact information. 

I do fear retaliation, both personal and professional, and I believe that being direct about my complaint and publishing my complaint is the safest path forward for myself and my family.

I am aware that my colleagues fear retaliation, both personal and professional.

And I think we have good reason to be afraid.

That is why I mentioned that fear in [Cosmos Hub Proposal 787](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/787)

In fact, the only reason I'm making this report is because I think that it is less risky to speak now, and speak fully, than to simply walk away.



## Incidents

Due to the fact that there have been exploits following several of my reports, it is hard for me to say if it is safe from a network security perspective to bring security issues to the Interchain Foundation.


### Amulet And the Fee Market





### Business Stabby and Composable

I watched Jack Zampolin and others associated with Strangelove Ventures, the team currently leading the growth of IBC, describe various means to stop the growth of IBC.  To date, Composable is the only team that has meaningfully grown the IBC network.  Composable has built IBC clients for both Cosmos and Polkadot, and designed 08-Wasm, a client interface.

Contrary to repeated, totally false claims made by the Interchain Foundation,
