# fasf-report
My report to the Swiss FASF on the activities of the Interchain Foundation.

I think that this information is also likely to benefit teams actively working in Cosmos.  

If you have security issues, I strongly recommend that you go directly to [Dev Ojha](x.com/valardragon) who is extremely accomplished, ethical, and wonderful.  I cannot recommend that you contact the Interchain Foundation due to the risks that:

* You will be harasssed
* Your issue will not be handled
* You will incur economic losses due to your report

For the P2P storms issue in particular, I needed to "disclose by demonstration", working in conjunction with SEAL911, an security reporting body of last resort.  I also needed to spend my company's money to make a legal threat to the interchain foundation, as they refused to remove my company's name from a provably inaccurate report they published concerning an issue involved in over $70,000,000,000 in economic losses.


## Who are you?

I'm Jacob Anthony Gadikian.  I've worked in Cosmos since about 2016, but I began to do full time work in the ecosystem in 2020.  I am the CEO and founder of Notional Ventures, which used to run 45 validators in the cosmos ecosystem.  

* I am a beneficiary of the ICF, as my validator nodes recieved delegations from them.
* My company was [elected as the security provider to the Cosmos Hub](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/104)

All of the information here, I have presented to the ICF.  Yet, the ICF has taken no action on it.  As time has gone on, things have only grown worse, and 

I am also a security researcher whose work tends to focus on the interplay between systems in cryptocurrency, and has been categorically denied by the Interchain foundation, despite ample proof.  I prefer to speak and act directly, so I am doing this in a public fashion, my report to the FASF is this repository.  I will speak to the FASF only over Signal, other than the initial e-mail that I send them with this repository and my signal contact information. 

I do fear retaliation, both personal and professional, and I believe that being direct about my complaint and publishing my complaint is the safest path forward for myself and my family.

I am aware that my colleagues fear retaliation, both personal and professional.

And I think we have good reason to be afraid.

That is why I mentioned that fear in [Cosmos Hub Proposal 787](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/787), which I authored.

In fact, the only reason I'm making this report is because I think that it is less risky to speak now, and speak fully, than to simply walk away.



## Incidents

Due to the fact that there have been exploits following several of my reports, it is hard for me to say if it is safe from a network security perspective to bring security issues to the Interchain Foundation.


### Amulet And the Fee Market

### Business Stabby and Composable

I watched Jack Zampolin and others associated with Strangelove Ventures, the team currently leading the growth of IBC, describe various means to stop the growth of IBC.  To date, Composable is the only team that has meaningfully grown the IBC network.  Composable has built IBC clients for both Cosmos and Polkadot, and designed 08-Wasm, a client interface.

### P2P Storms

I have deeply documented p2p storms in many ways, and have included PDF files here that describe it.  You can find those in the [p2p-storms](./p2pstorms/) folder.

P2P Storms have been used to exploit Cosmos networks financially, including [Luna Classic](https://github.com/notional-labs/notional/blob/master/incidents/WTF%20HAPPENED%20TO%20TERRA.pdf) and [Osmosis](https://www.range.org/blog/levana-security-incident-in-depth-analysis).  The links contain information on both exploits.  Here is the chronology of exploits:

* Game of Zones - 2020
* Sentinel - 2021
* Luna Classic - May 2022
* Stride - August 2023
* Osmosis - December 2024

Only the exploits on 

My reports predate any of the financial exploits, and date back to [2021](./p2pstorms/2023-08-15_report_1395694%20(1).pdf).

### Banana King

#### Lack of field length limitations in ibc


**Reports**
* First reported by x.com/@ctrl_felix to the Interchain Foundation using their formal security reporitng process.  
  * ignored
* Reported by x.com/@getcoldy to me 
* Reported by me to ICF



### IBC Version 3.0.0 and the cosmos hub

#### Use of deprecated module on cosmos hub, leading to an exploit of the cosmos hub that caused 30,000 ATOM of user funds to get stuck

Contrary to repeated, totally false claims made by the Interchain Foundation,
